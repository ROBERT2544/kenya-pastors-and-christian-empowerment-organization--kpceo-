                <p><p>The spread of the gospel in the world has grown on the wide range since the emergence of the Missionaries without exemption of Kenya who besides the spreading of the gospel also built Missionary churches, schools, hospitals etc. However the growing population has led to shortage of social services and amenities both in rural and urban areas such as education, health, food, safe drinking water, shelter, etc.</p>
                    <p>The under privileged vulnerable groups are facing several problems which include;</p>
                <ol>
                    <section class="activities1"> <li>Pastors starving with no one to help and expecting Christians in their churches to help but in vain due to lack of jobs and sources of income to these believers. The problems include lack of food, medication, transportation, clothing, income generating projects etc.</li>
                        <li>Pastorsâ€™ children drop out of schools due to lack of school fees and tuition hence a laughing stock in the society[s].</li>
                        <li> Needy children are both from poor families and some are orphans, as we look back to several programs we enjoyed as needy children, the problems are wide I e starvation [hunger], clothing, no education, child labor, early marriages, high risks of rape and defilement, child abuse, child negligence etc. Both in rural areas and urban centers.</li>
                        <li>Youths face several problems I e discrimination, un employment, lack of jobs, shortage or no vacation training support, lack of career guidance, shortage of youths empowerment development funds etc. As they wait for government intervention but in vain due to little opportunities offered by government which is not enough for all youths. This exposes many youths to high crime rates like rape, defilement, sexual workers, drug abuse, theft and robbery due to idolism.</li>
                        <li> Several communities lack fresh clean and safe water for drinking and use in both rural and urban areas leading to long distances in search for water, use of dirty water from ponds, rivers and streams in rural areas. This causes cholera, dysentery, bilharzia, river blindness, diahorrea etc. to people leading to death.</li>
                        <li> Farmers have large amounts of land but use small pieces of land due to lack of capital to invest in farming I e new modern farming technology, use of machines, fertilizers, high breeds of animals, birds and seeds etc. This has led to low production of food hence leading to hunger [starvation] which leads to malnutrition and deaths of people in communities.</li>
                       <li>Elderly persons face serious problems like hunger, shelter, medical care and other social amenities of which the government cannot meet all to them hence suffocating leading to death.</li>
                        <li>Persons Living With Disabilities[PLWDs] are in the worst state ie hunger, lack of medical care, stigmatization and lack of income generating projects which has left them suffering. </li>
                        <li>Family couples in community[s] money due to lack jobs, income generating projects and financial support etc. This has led to domestic violence, family negligence, lack of church support, family negligence, single parenthood and unnecessary killings in the society.</li>
                        <li>Continuing deterioration of the global environment resulting from unsustainable patterns of consumption and production, particularly in urban societies which is a matter of grave, aggravating poverty and imbalances.</li>
                        <li>Church structures are temporary and are in a state of falling and others most especially in urban areas are for renting, this causes worry in believers of structures falling on them and rentals are in the state of vacating leading to loss of hope in the future church. </li></p>
